Read data from Google BigQuery with Dask

## Installation

## Example

`dask-bigquery` assumes that you are already authenticated. 

```python
import dask_bigquery

ddf = dask_bigquery.read_gbq(
    project_id="your_project_id",
    dataset_id="your_dataset",
    table_id="your_table",
)

ddf.head()
```

## Run tests locally

To run the tests locally you need to be authenticated and have a project created on that account. If you're using a service account, when created you need to select the role of "BigQuery Admin" in the section "Grant this service account access to project". 

You can run the tests by doing:

`$ DASK_BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id> pytest dask_bigquery`
